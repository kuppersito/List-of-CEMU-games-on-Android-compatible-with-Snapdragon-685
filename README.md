A repository containing custom drivers for <a href="https://github.com/skyline-emu/skyline">Skyline</a>, <a href="https://github.com/strato-emu/strato">Strato</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Vita3K/Vita3K-Android">Vita3K</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin">Dolphin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp">PPSSPP</a> and Winlator Bionic.

- Qualcomm drivers are extracted from qualcomm-soc-using devices, like Smartphones or the Oculus Quest.
- Turnip drivers are compiled from <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/index.html">Mesa</a>.

For TWRP or Magisk modules, join the Adreno <a href="https://t.me/adreno_konabess">Konabess Support Telegram group</a>.

# Reporting issues

### Removed the Issues page since people do not bother reading this section.
If you encounter issues with your games, please consult the emulator's devs first. I just build these drivers. I am unable to fix anything and I can only report technical feedback given to me by the devs so I can report to Mesa (the source).
Any questions unrelated to games are welcome.
Thank you for understanding.
